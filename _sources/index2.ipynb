    "# Project proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Demo of a data analysis project for DSCI 522 (Data Science workflows); a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. \n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to allow tech employees in Canada to get a reasonable estimation of how much they will potentially earn given their skill set and years of experience. Fresh graduates and seasoned employees would benefit from an analysis tool that allows them to predict their earning potential. While the Human Resources (HR) department of companies has access to this market information, tech employees are mostly clueless about what their market value is. Therefore, a salary predictor tool could assist them in the negotiation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) data, we did Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) and came up with some features that may help predict the expected yearly compensation of tech employees. We describe the data, selected features, and the modeling process which you should be able to reproduce following the usage steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set used in this project is from the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey), which is conducted annually. The survey data set has nearly 80,000 responses. There are several useful features that could be extracted from this survey such as education level, location, the language used, job type, all of which are potentially associated with annual compensation.\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "![The dependency diagram of the Makefile](../out.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "-   GNU make 4.2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python dependencies can be found in the `tech_salary_pred_env.yaml` file. However, you do not have to manually install these dependencies. You need to install `conda` (v4.10.3) and then follow the installation instructions described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two suggested ways to run this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "*note - the instructions in this section also depends on running this in a UNIX shell (e.g., terminal or Git Bash)*\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this analysis using Docker, clone/download this repository, use\n",
    "the command line to navigate to the root of this project on your\n",
    "computer, and then type the following (filling in PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER\n",
    "with the absolute path to the root of this project on your computer).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run --rm -v PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER:/home/tech_salary_predictor_canada_us ssingh90/tech_salary_predictor_canada_us make -C '/home/tech_salary_predictor_canada_us' all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To reset the repo to a clean state, with no intermediate or results files, run the following command at the command line/terminal from the root directory of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run --rm -v PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER:/home/tech_salary_predictor_canada_us ssingh90/tech_salary_predictor_canada_us make -C '/home/tech_salary_predictor_canada_us' clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Without using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You need tech_salary_pred_env.yaml file to do the following steps\n",
    "for this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate the analysis, clone this GitHub repository, install the\n",
    "dependencies listed below, and run the following command at the command\n",
    "line/terminal from the root directory of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "The R dependencies are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   R version 3.6.1 and R packages:\n",
    "    -   tidyverse==1.3.1\n",

    "The final report can be found [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/tech_salary_predictor_canada_us/report.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After carrying out EDA, we realize that the following features might help us predict the salary of tech workers: years of experience, education level, programming languages used, and their role (full-stack developer, front-end developer, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data corresponding to the four features in the survey, we created plots to visualize how the four features impact on the annual compensation of developers. As we can see from the plots, a large professional coding years and certain programming language skills(Bash,C,SQL,HTML,Java) would have positive influence on the average annual compensation. Then we dig a little deeper by visualizing the combination of these two features in a heatmap, which shows the average annual compensation given the number of professional coding years and combination of programming language skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a multiple linear regression model to see the relationship between these features and the annual compensation.\n",
    "To simplify our analysis, we focused on Canada. We initially thought of building the model on Canada data. However, we learned from our EDA that there is pay disparity and currency conversion involved. In the future, we plan to include USA in the model and handle those discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the regression model can also provide other important information such as the weight of each feature or how much each of those features we picked contributes to the overall predicted annual compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our model and selected features, we plan to use R squared score as the score metric and see how well the tuned model can generalize on the test data. For the purpose of visualizing the performance of our prediction, we will plot the regression line on the scattered data points to infer whether the relationship between features and response is linear or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research question is:\n",
    "> To predict the expected salary of a tech employee in Canada given their number of years of experience, education level, programming languages used, and role\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is a predictive question, also extending to following sub-questions:\n",
    "1. Which features have significantly statistical effect on the response (inference)\n",
    "2. Whether the model is robust (model estimation, a predictive problem)\n",
    "3. The confidence interval of predictions (predictive)\n",
